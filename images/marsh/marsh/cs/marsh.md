A knowledge graph is how computers organize what they know. Each oval is a thing, and each arrow is a fact connecting two things. In this diagram, "Heron lives in Marsh," "Boardwalk crosses Marsh," and "Water is home to Crabs." The green oval in the center is the marsh itself, with everything else branching out from it. The more connections you add, the more the computer "understands" about the marsh — just like you do when you look at the painting.
