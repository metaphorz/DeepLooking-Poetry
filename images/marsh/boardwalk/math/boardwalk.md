The boardwalk follows a linear path through the marsh, creating a one-dimensional trajectory through a two-dimensional landscape. The planks form a repeating rectangular tessellation. The railing posts are evenly spaced, approximating a discrete sampling of the continuous curve of the walkway. The vanishing point where parallel edges converge illustrates projective geometry.
