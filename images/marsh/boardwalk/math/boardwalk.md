The boardwalk curves gently through the marsh. In math, a smooth curve like this is called a spline. The red dots in the diagram are like the railing posts on the boardwalk — a few fixed points along the path. The smooth black line is the curve that connects them. A spline finds the smoothest possible path through a set of points, just like a boardwalk railing bends smoothly from post to post.
