Sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow. When it hits the atmosphere, tiny gas molecules scatter the light in all directions. This is called Rayleigh scattering. Blue light has a short wavelength, so it gets scattered much more than red light, which has a longer wavelength. The diagram shows this: blue light on the left is scattered about 5 times more than red light on the right. That scattered blue light reaches your eyes from every direction — and that is why the sky looks blue.
