The luminous blue sky in Guigou's 1867 painting was most likely made with cobalt blue (CoAl₂O₄), the go-to pigment for mid-19th century French landscape painters. Discovered in 1802 and commercially available by the 1830s, cobalt blue offered a warm, semi-transparent blue ideal for open skies. Mixed with lead white, it captures the brilliant clarity of Provençal light. Unlike earlier blues such as ultramarine from lapis lazuli, cobalt blue was affordable and stable — a breakthrough in materials science that helped make plein air painting practical.
