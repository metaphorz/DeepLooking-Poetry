The towering cliffs in Guigou's painting are limestone — a sedimentary rock made mostly of calcite (CaCO₃) from ancient marine shells and coral. Over millions of years, rainwater mixed with CO₂ forms a weak acid that slowly dissolves the rock, carving out caves, sinkholes, and the dramatic cliff faces seen throughout Provence. This process is called karst erosion.
