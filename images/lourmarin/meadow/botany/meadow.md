The green meadow in Guigou's painting would have been alive with wildflowers typical of Provence: wild thyme and rosemary scenting the air, red poppies dotting the grass, and yellow broom brightening the hillsides. These plants belong to the garrigue — the scrubby, aromatic landscape of the Mediterranean basin. Adapted to hot dry summers and thin limestone soils, Provençal meadows host over 2,000 plant species, many found nowhere else in France.
