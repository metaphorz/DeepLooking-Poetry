\section{Overview}

Poetry Deep Looking is an interactive web application that pairs visual art with poetry. Users explore paintings by hovering over segmented regions, each of which reveals a contextually matched poem excerpt. The application uses AI-generated segmentation masks (via Google Gemini Pro) to map artwork regions to poems.

\section{Gallery}

The application opens with a gallery of artwork thumbnails. Each card shows the painting and its attribution. Clicking a card opens the interactive viewer.

\label{fig:gallery}
\end{figure}

\section{Hover Interaction}

In the viewer, moving the cursor over a recognized region displays a popup with the poem title, poet name, a generated illustration, and a highlighted excerpt. The popup follows the cursor and updates as the user moves between regions.

\end{figure}

\section{Click-to-Freeze Popup}

Clicking while a popup is visible pins it in place. The pinned popup displays a close button (\textsf{X}) in the top-right corner and converts the poem title into a hyperlink that opens the full poem in a new browser tab.

\section{Technical Architecture}

The application is a single \texttt{index.html} file with embedded CSS and JavaScript:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Segmentation masks} are generated by Google Gemini Pro, producing flat-color region maps.
\item \textbf{Hover detection} uses pixel lookup on a hidden canvas --- no polygon data needed.
\item \textbf{Proportional coordinate mapping} handles the mismatch between displayed artwork size and mask dimensions.
\item \textbf{Poem data} is embedded as a JavaScript object, with each region mapped to a title, poet, excerpt, illustration, keyword, and URL.
\end{itemize}
